# Chunky McChunkFace #

## About ##
Chunky McChunkFace is a versatile chunk loader mod for Minecraft that ensures your desired areas stay loaded even when you're not around. Say goodbye to chunk unloading frustrations!

Features:
* Chunk Loader Block: Activate chunk loading by interacting with the Chunky McChunkFace block.
* Visual Indicator: The hourglass-inspired model visually shows the enabled or disabled state of the chunk loader.
* Automatic Disable: If all players who interacted with the chunk loader are offline for a configurable period (default: 7 in-game days (140 minutes)), it automatically turns off.
* Upgradeable Range: Expand the loaded area by building a pyramid of allowed blocks beneath the chunk loader. (Like you would with a beacon)
* Configuration Options: Fine-tune settings such as base range, tier ranges, and offline time.
* Radius Renderer: Toggle the radius renderer with a keybind to visualize the loaded chunks with a translucent box.
* Location: When holding a Chunk Loader item, nearby chunk loaders will display an outline, providing a visual indication of their locations.

Keep your farms, buildings, and important areas continuously loaded with Chunky McChunkFace. Enjoy a seamless Minecraft experience even when you're away.
